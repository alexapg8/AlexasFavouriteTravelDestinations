        <p>On this Blogspot I will talk about my <strong>favourite cities</strong> I’ve travelled to: <a href="NewYork.php">New York</a>, <a href="SanFrancisco.php"">San Francisco</a> and Honolulu, Hawaii. I will write what I liked about them as well as ways I <em>saved money</em> and made the most of my trips.</p>
        <p>For this <strong>first post</strong> I will focus on Oahu, mostly Waikiki beach. I’ve never been a fan of going to the beach, maybe it has something to do with living so close to it all of my life, however once you go to <strong>Waikiki Beach</strong> you fall in love. Oahu has the perfect weather in may, not too hot but <em>just perfect</em> for you to go to the beach, sightseeing and hiking.</p>
        <p>As always, I chose to stay at a <em>hostel</em> to save money, and this time it was at the <strong>perfect location</strong>, just walking distance of the busiest avenue and the beach! Waikiki's <strong>Kalakaua Ave</strong> is the perfect combination of <em>city stores and nature</em> with the beach just steps away, it’s safe and beautiful to walk either during the day as well as night time.</p>

            <p>The city by the bay, San Francisco is one of the most beautiful cities I've been to, <strong>The Golden Gate Bridge</strong> is the highlight and there are so many spots to see it from to admire its <em>beauty</em>. Across from it you can go to a picturesque town called <strong>Sausalito</strong>.</p>

            <p>Welcome to New York, throughout my visit to <strong>The Big Apple</strong> I could not get that song out of my head, and as the song says: <em>The lights are so bright</em>. Beautiful at night and during the day there is so much to do in <strong>New York City</strong>. I will also tell you about our encounter with <em>firefighters</em>, this trip was full of adventures and stories to tell!</p>
